# Module 6 - Classes, Enumerations, Unit testing and Client Program

## Mortgage calculator simulator

In this mortgage calculator assignment, classes are used to encapsulate the main logic, such as creating MortgageRate class that holds details like 
Fixed and Variable interest rate, PaymentFrequency that holds the options of how often payment is set and lastly, a variable called AMORTIZATION that contains a list of available durations of mortgage. 

Unit testing is implemented to validate the accuracy of the calculation logic across different input scenarios. Finally, a client program ties everything together by accepting user input, initializing the calculator with the given values, and displaying the computed payment frequency of mortgage payment.
